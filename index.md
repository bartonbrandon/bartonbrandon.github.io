Hello :) I am Brandon, a doctorate student in physics. I work in [Juan Carrasquilla's](https://www.phys.ethz.ch/the-department/people/person-detail.MzM2NzEw.TGlzdC81MTUsMTE3MjU5OTI5OQ==.html) research group in the Insititute for Theoretical Physics at ETH ZÃ¼rich. Previously, I completed my mater's thesis work with [Lincoln Carr](https://people.mines.edu/lcarr/) at the Colorado School of Mines.

My work is focused on computational methods for quantum physics. In particular, I enjoy developing new classical and quantum algorithms for various problems in physics and other domains.

Thanks for visiting my website!
