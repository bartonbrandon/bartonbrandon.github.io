Welcome to my website! I'm Brandon, a master's student in computational and applied mathematics at the Colorado School of Mines. My advisor is [Prof. Lincoln Carr](https://people.mines.edu/lcarr/). 

I spend most of my time thinking about quantum computing, hard optimization problems, and computational quantum physics. When I am not doing physics, I enjoy riding my bike and praticing jiu-jitsu. Please find some of my recent works below, and please reach out if you have any questions.

This summer, I am a graduate intern at the Flatiron Institute Center for Computational Quantum Physics (CCQ). In fall 2024, I will start my PhD in Physics at ETH ZÃ¼rich with [Prof. Juan Carrasquilla](https://www.phys.ethz.ch/the-department/people/person-detail.MzM2NzEw.TGlzdC81MTUsMTE3MjU5OTI5OQ==.html).
